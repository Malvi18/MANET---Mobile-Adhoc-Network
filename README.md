# MANET---Mobile-Adhoc-Network
MANET - Mobile Adhoc Network


The mobile adhoc network is a new network type which caters to the needs of the changing networking needs. It is the adhoc network of mobile devices. It is infrastructure less. Such networks may operate themselves or may be connected to the larger internet. Each device in MANET is free to move in any direction. The devices are being equipped with a router and must thus be in a position to transfer data whenever essential. The connection is, of course, wireless and the network may also be with limited range like LAN instead of connecting to the internet. The protocols to be used in MANET may differ, depending upon the capabilities of the devices, packet drop rate and other factors. There are various types of mobile adhoc networks depending on the location of these devices and the way in which they are used. Some of the popular types are:


VANET: Vehicular Ad hoc Network. This is when the devices are used to communicate between vehicles. It may also be used for communication between vehicles and roadside equipments. It can be used to transfer between newly web enabled devices on the road.


IMANET: This stands for internet based MANET. These are mobile ad hoc networks which link to the gateway device for the internet
